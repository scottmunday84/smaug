Subject Arena~
Text
I've added an arena to the game. It works pretty much
like the one on DS. Use the challenge command to...guess
what - challenge. Wait until the challenged opponent
declines or accepts. Both combatants are restored before
and after the fight. After the fight, both are transferred
back to the altar. You can't quit or recall while in
the arena, and you can't quit when you have challenged
someone or have been challenged. If you want to withdraw
a challenge, use the dismiss command.

Enjoy,

The arena consists of 15 rooms now. When you leave
the arena (no matter whether you're winner or loser),
most maladictions are removed (plus sever, gouge and
assassination).
Winner and loser are moved to separate rooms now.

Enjoy,

Subject Bugfix~
Text
Fixed a bug in get_curr_stat. Weaken, plague, poison 
and other stat-modifying spells/skills have an actual
effect now. So, weakening someone might make them remove
their weapon(s) now. (Same goes for plague, etc.)
