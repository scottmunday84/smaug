   Paradox MUD is a RoT based, PK centered MUD. We want to provide you,
   the players, with a high quality environment to play in while not
   forgetting that you visit our MUD to have fun. We, the immortal staff,
   do not run Paradox MUD to have a place to boost our egos by punishing
   immature players but we are all part of a community working together
   to make this game enjoyable for everyone who feels that testing his/her
   strength and skill against other players is more fun and more challenging
   than playing in a non PK environment.
